/* INTERNET */

/* WHY KNOW ABOUT IT?

It can break. When this happens you can troubleshoot if you know what is going on */

/* DARPA created internet. 1969 first computer message (LO). TCP/IP protocol used by computers to transfer info to and from computers. Up to 1980s internet used to transfer data of research btween facilities.
Intranet = connection of machines in one area (Local access network)...precursor of internet 
WWW = world wide web = unified system to connect computers with different software = gives directions to where to look
http = protocol to transfer info */

/* ANATOMY OF INTERNET */

/* client = device receiving info or data
node = any computer or server that data makes a pit stop at before going to client
server = serves information (data stored on large machine) */

/* ISP = internet service provider = comcast = node
modem = node in house that is connected to ISP hub
router = connects devices through modem = route traffic */

/* DOMAIN, IP, DNS */

/* domain = name of website
IP = like bank routing number = each device has one = address
DNS = domain name system */

/* HOW DOES BROWSER WORK */

/* software program that 1) establishes a persistent connection with the server 2) translate web program that OP system can understand  
browsers interpret web programs differently
*/

/* HOW DOES MOBILE INTERNET WORK?*/

/* router = cell tower
ISP usually provides cell service as well
modem = gateway server (WAP = protocol that optimizes data for phones) */

/* ANATOMY OF A WEBSITE */

/* website = set of files (code)
browser finds index.html and loads
front file (main instructions) = index.html 
style.css makes it look pretty
back-end file = adds functionality (does the work... ie calculations etc)*/

/* ANATOMY OF A MOBILE SITE */

/* responsive web design 
mobile apps vs mobile website
app give you html, css, photos or package (no back end folder though)
mobile interprets html, css, photos through browser 
*/

/* NETSCAPE */

/* invented new language = live script = javascript
implemented SSL = secure sockets layer (buy things without worrying...birth of ecommerce)
netscape fueled Bill Gates to create Internet Explorer */
