/* WHY CARE ABOUT COMPUTERS! */

/* everyone uses a computer but doesn't know the interworkings of how a computer works
*how can you make a desktop app but you don't know how REM works */

/* WHAT IS A COMPUTER */

/* computer = anything that computes
-solve problems in which parameters are implemented
-computers all around you - calculator, car, watches */

/* HOW DOES A COMPUTER WORK */

/* give computer X information and it will return Y
CPU = Computer Processing Unit = little square with alot of transistors = take electricity to process info
Hard drives = alot like cds with alot more information = stores permanent information
RAM = Random Access Memory = stores not permanent data = display website in browser = computers freeze when RAM is to low
  */

/* HOW DO COMPUTERS SEND & RECEIVE INFORMATION */

/* computer peripherals = mouse, printers, desktop, keyboard,audio system (things outside closed computer system)
computers receive info via peripherals and then send information that corresponds with the received info*/

/* Machine Speak &  Matrix*/

/* computers have their own language(0 & 1 binary system) and its called machine code
as humans it is very hard to write and learn this language 
motherboard = electricity go through = 1 stop = 0 (take about a millionth of a second)
basic commands are hundreds of zero and ones which makes it really hard to read
low level code = machine speak (0 & 1)(very customizable)
medium level code = inbetween code (symbols...vietnamese code)
high level code = web development*/

/* WHAT ARE OPERATING SYSTEMS */

/* Allow laymen users to use computers (not scientist)
it is the first software that allowed people to own and use their own PCs (personal computers)
OP = steering wheel = steers wheel but you don't know details
ms-dos first "successful" OP....had to type in commands and file pathways to find things (to much memorizing) */

/* MODERN OP */

/* Steve Jobs vs. Bill Gates fight over MS-DOS better
Steve Jobs stole Xerox idea of GUI = Graphic User Interface 
Bill Gates then stole it from Steve Jobs
OP = windows, linux, macos
linux = original Open Source project
*/

/* DESKTOP SOFTWARE */

/* desktop = OP
software used within the limits of your computers hardware
OP or desktop = GUI that takes client input and breaks down into machine code 
mini operating system = applications = doll with doll inside itself
platform created with OP so applications made by other people can be used by OP
